<h2 style="color:white">Part 1:The Beginning......</h2>
<p style="color:white"> ISRO was formed on August 15, 1969 and superseded INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness space technology.Vikram
    Sarabhai played a prominent role in devloping Isro. 
    Dr.Sarabhai is considered as the Father of the Indian space program; He was a great institution builder and established or helped to establish a large number of institutions in diverse fields. He was instrumental in establishing the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad : after returning from Cambridge to an independent India in 1947, he persuaded charitable trusts controlled by his family and friends to endow a research institution near home in Ahmedabad. Thus, Vikram Sarabhai founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad on November 11, 1947. He was only 28 at that time.

<h2 style ="color:white">Part 2:First Satellite:</h2>
<p style="color:white">ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet space agency Interkosmos in 1975. In 1980, ISRO launched satellite RS-1 onboard SLV-3, making India only the seventh country on the planet to undertake orbital launches.Aryabhata was India's first satellite, named after the astronomer. It was launched on 19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar, a Soviet rocket launch and development site in Astrakhan Oblast using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle.

<h2 style="color:white">Part 3:Chandrayaann 1:</h2>
<p style="color:white">
        Chandrayaan-1, India's first mission to Moon, was launched successfully on October 22, 2008 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The spacecraft orbited around the Moon at a height of 100 km from the lunar surface and provided chemical, mineralogical and photo-geologic mapping of the Moon. The spacecraft carried a total of 11 scientific instruments developed in India and other countries.
        
        After completion of the major mission objectives, the orbit was raised to 200 km in May 2009. The satellite made more than 3400 orbits around the moon in its life time. The mission was concluded after the communication with the spacecraft was lost on August 29, 2009.
        The payloads onboard Chandrayaan-1 are,
        
        Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC)
        Hyper Spectral Imager (HySI)
        Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI)
        High Energy X - ray Spectrometer (HEX)
        Moon Impact Probe(MIP)
        Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS)
        Near Infrared Spectrometer (SIR – 2)
        Sub keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA)
        Miniature Synthetic Aperature Radar (Mini SAR)
        Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3)
        Radiation Dose Monitor (RADOM)</p>

        <h2 style="color:white">Part 4: Mangalyaan:</h2>
        <p style="color:white">The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), unofficially known as Mangalyaan[11] (Sanskrit: Maṅgala 'Mars', Yāna 'Craft, Vehicle'),[12][13] was a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[14][15][16][17] It was India's first interplanetary mission[18] and it made ISRO the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency.[19] It made India the first Asian nation to reach the Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so on its maiden attempt. It also made India the third nation to orbit another planet after the United States and the Soviet Union.[20][21][22][23]

                The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 (UTC) on 5 November 2013.[5][24] The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.[6] The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manœuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).[25] After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.</p>

        <h2 style="color:white">Part 5:Chandrayaan-2:</h2>
    <p style="color:white">Chandrayaan-2 mission is a highly complex mission, which represents a significant technological leap compared to the previous missions of ISRO. It comprised an Orbiter, Lander and Rover to explore the unexplored South Pole of the Moon. The mission is designed to expand the lunar scientific knowledge through detailed study of topography, seismography, mineral identification and distribution, surface chemical composition, thermo-physical characteristics of top soil and composition of the tenuous lunar atmosphere, leading to a new understanding of the origin and evolution of the Moon.

            After the injection of Chandrayaan-2, a series of maneuvers were carried out to raise its orbit and on August 14, 2019, following Trans Lunar Insertion (TLI) maneuver, the spacecraft escaped from orbiting the earth and followed a path that took it to the vicinity of the Moon. On August 20, 2019, Chandrayaan-2 was successfully inserted into lunar orbit. While orbiting the moon in a 100 km lunar polar orbit, on September 02, 2019, Vikram Lander was separated from the Orbiter in preparation for landing. Subsequently, two de-orbit maneuvers were performed on Vikram Lander so as to change its orbit and begin circling the moon in a 100 km x 35 km orbit. Vikram Lander descent was as planned and normal performance was observed upto an altitude of 2.1 km. Subsequently communication from lander to the ground stations was lost</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Faliure of Chandrayaan-2</h1>
    <p style="color:white">Isro chairman S Somanath has given three main reasons that led to the crashlanding of the Vikram lander on September 6, 2019 just minutes before the touchdown. The Isro chief said the “five engines of the lander generating higher thrust, limitation of the software to detect errors and the small landing site” were the three primary causes for the crashlanding of the lander.</p>

<h2 style="color:white">Part 5:Chandrayaan-3</h2>
<p style="color:white">With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
        The Vikram lander from Chandrayaan-3 successfully touched down as planned at 18:04 local time (12:34 GMT).
        Celebrations have broken out across the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying "India is now on the Moon".
        "We have reached where no other country could. It's a joyous occasion," he added. Mr Modi was watching the event live from South Africa where he is attending the Brics summit.
        
        Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said the successful landing "is not our work alone, this is the work of a generation of Isro scientists".
        India's achievement comes just days after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft spun out of control and crashed into the Moon.
        The crash also put the spotlight on how difficult it is to land in the south pole region where the surface is "very uneven" and "full of craters and boulders".
        India's second lunar mission, which also attempted to soft-land there in 2019, was unsuccessful - its lander and rover were destroyed, though its orbiter survived.</p>

<h2 style="color:white">Gaganyaan:</h2>
<p style="color: white">Gaganyaan, crewed spacecraft being developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The first uncrewed test flight is planned for 2024, with a second uncrewed test flight and the first crewed flight planned for 2025. India would become the fourth nation to launch its own crewed spacecraft, after the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, and China.

    Gaganyaan will consist of two parts, the crew module (CM) and the service module (SM), which together will form the orbital module. The CM will be shaped like a truncated cone and is designed to carry up to three astronauts. The CM will sit on top of the SM, which will contain the propulsion and power systems of the craft. Upon reentry the CM will separate from the SM and splash down in the ocean. Gaganyaan will launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on top of the Human Rated Launch Vehicle (HRLV), a version of India’s most powerful rocket, the Launch Vehicle Mark III (LVM3) that has been modified for crewed spaceflight.
    
    Development on the Indian crewed spacecraft began in 2012. The LVM3 had its first flight in December 2014 during which it carried a CM mockup on a suborbital trajectory that ended with a successful splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in his 2018 speech for Indian Independence Day that the first crewed flight in the Gaganyaan program would take place in 2022, the 75th anniversary of India’s independence. Four astronauts, Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, Ajit Krishnan, Angad Pratap, and Shubhanshu Shukla, all pilots in the Indian Air Force, were selected for the program. The four did their first part of their training in Russia in early 2020 and the remainder at ISRO’s astronaut training facility in Bengaluru. However, the program was delayed due to the global coronavirus pandemic.
    
    The second uncrewed test flight will carry Vyommitra, a humanoid robot with female features who can speak with ground controllers and read instrument panels in the spacecraft. The first crewed flight will carry three astronauts who will spend up to a week in low Earth orbit.</p>
